  ## Description:

  Book Search Engine is a MERN stack application that makes use of the GraphQL API and Apollo Server. Upon first usage, the user may search for any book of their choosing. They are then presented with 10 results. Each result contains an image of the book, title, author, and description.
  
  The application also allows: 

  * The ability for a new user to sign up and and an existing user to login.
  * The ability for logged in users to save multiple searched books.
    * Once selected book will be marked informing the user that the book has already been saved.
  * The ability for logged in users to delete books from their saved books.
